BUGS:
+ Adjust the effective sequence size depending on the number of `0' characters
  found in the sequences.

FEATURES:
+ Filtering:
  - integrate BLAST SEG and DUST code
  - dont filter in SAFT, use another program upstream and some glue
  - create an AA and a Nucleic alphabets to filter out lower case letters
+ How to handle + and - strand for nucleic acids and the 6 frames of a
  translated search?
+ Finish implementing the Benjamini and Hochberg p-values adjustment.
+ In SaftFasta: add saft_fasta_read_fd and saft_fasta_iter_fd to work on file
  descriptors instead of paths. This will allow to read querries from stdin.
+ Change SaftError to have different log levels.

FIXME: there might be `FIXME's scattered throughout the code that require attention
